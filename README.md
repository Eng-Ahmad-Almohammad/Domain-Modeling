# Domain Modeling
### Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an *object-oriented* model.
## Define a constructor and initialize properties
### To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.
|Property|Data|Type|
|--------|----|-----|
|epicRating|1 to 10|Number|
|hasAnimals|true or false|Boolean|
### Here's an implementation of the EpicFailVideo constructor function.
